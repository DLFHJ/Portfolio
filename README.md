# Minimal Portfolio (scaffold)

This is a sleek, modern, minimalist portfolio scaffold.

Files added/updated:

- `index.html` — HTML structure: header, hero, about, projects, contact, footer.
- `styles/main.css` — Responsive, theme-aware styles with CSS variables.
- `scripts/main.js` — Mobile nav toggle, smooth scroll, and theme toggle persisted to localStorage.

How to preview

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's Live Server extension).
2. Or from a simple static server (Python):

```powershell
# from the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Customizing

- Replace project cards in `index.html` under the `#projects` section.
- Update the email in the contact section.
- Tweak colors in `styles/main.css` variables.

Notes

- The theme toggle saves preference to `localStorage`.
- Accessibility: there is a skip link and ARIA attributes on nav controls.
